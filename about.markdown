I'm Noel Rivas, and I have been writing software for more than 20 years.

Writing software requires lots of memory use. I'm not talking about computer memory, but human memory. Just to get started, one often has to learn and load in human RAM a good chunk of data, from business requirements to technical details.

All that memory juggling seems to have, for me at least, interesting effects, emotional and cognitive.

ðŸ§Ÿ Sometimes I end a day of work and feel like a zombie. It takes about 30 minutes to recover from the zombie state. 

ðŸš€ Other days when I'm excited about a solution that's in the works, I find it hard to cool down and stop thinking about it

Why does this happen? What is, exactly, this zombie state, or what is going on when my brain gets stuck thinking something? More importantly, what can I do about those states, when I find them unpleasant or un productive?

That's what I'm trying to explore here: what's going on, and what can I do about it.

Does any of this feel familiar? Drop me a line! I'd love to chat and hear how it is for you: blog [at] noelr.dev
