_House work as a means to cool the mind off and reclaim attention._

Attention —or at least the way I experience attention— is a funny phenomenon. It feels as if it were a physical thing, an object that moves in and out of my body.

Whenever my mind goes nuts, engulfed in worry or frenetic thinking, that object that is attention comes up into my head and hides there. It nearly stops interacting with the outside world; with people, objects, surroundings.

To stop it from going around in circles at full speed, I try to project attention outward.

To that effect, doing something that requires interacting physically with the world is often helpful.

A few examples:

- Do the dishes (there are _always_ dishes)
- Remove weeds from my ferns and plants
- Tidy up my office or other space around the house
- Get groceries
- Cook

Usually those are brief interventions; quick activities that I find useful to cool the brain off before resuming some creative work.
