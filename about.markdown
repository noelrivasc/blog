  <h1>Hey, I'm Noel</h1>
  <p>I write code and I get distracted. A lot.</p>
  <p>There are too many things going on in my head, and in the screens swarming around it. Often, that doesn't feel good.</p>
  <p>These are notes about reclaiming my focus and finding satisfying ways to use my own brain.</p>
  <p>Hopefully, some those notes are useful to you, too.</p>
